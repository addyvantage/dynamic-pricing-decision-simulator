# Synthetic Data Plan

This document will explain how realistic synthetic data patterns will be generated for simulation.

Constrained peak periods are intentionally included to reflect real operating conditions where demand can outpace available capacity. Capacity breaches are treated as a deliberate design feature, not a data quality issue, because they create the stress conditions that pricing and operations teams must manage. This allows scenario comparisons to evaluate not only revenue outcomes, but also service pressure and trade-offs under load. The result is a more decision-relevant dataset for business discussions and interview walkthroughs.
